# Satellite Imagery Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **URL Structure in the HERE Maps API Requests**:
   - Fixed the ordering of query parameters in the URL
   - Ensured the path portion has the proper format: `/{zoom}/{x}/{y}/{format}`
   - Fixed query parameter structure to use `?` for the first parameter and `&` for additional parameters

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Added detailed comments explaining the correct URL structure
   - Updated function documentation with parameter descriptions 
   - Created a README file explaining the fix for other developers

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error messages when API key is missing
   - Enhanced fallback mechanism with multiple URL patterns
   - Ensured mock satellite image generation works correctly when API fails

4. **Consistency Fixes**:
   - Made sure all satellite request functions use the same format
   - Fixed duplicate code in the mock image generation part
   - Updated example scripts to use the correct URL structure

## Testing

The fix has been successfully tested with:
- A standalone script that successfully retrieves satellite imagery
- The main application that falls back to mock imagery when API limits are reached

## Next Steps

For full satellite imagery to work in production:
1. Ensure you have a valid API key with sufficient quota
2. Set the API key in your environment or .env file
3. Use `--satellite` flag when running map commands

## Example Usage

```bash
# Set API key in .env file
echo "API_KEY=your_here_maps_api_key" > .env

# Run with satellite imagery
python3 main.py map 4815075 --satellite
```

The fixes ensure that even when the API is unavailable, the application gracefully falls back to mock satellite imagery to allow development and testing to continue.
